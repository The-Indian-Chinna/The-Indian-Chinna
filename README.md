## Hi, my name is Akhil Chinnakotla ðŸ‘‹
I am a ***software engineer*** with a passion for Full-Stack Development, Operating Systems,  as well as Machine Learning. I constantly explore these areas of interest by engaging in ***project-based learning*** through professional, academic and personal avenues. Currently I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in ***Computer Engineering at Purdue University*** with a more software focused course selection. In my free time I like to experiment with New Frameworks and Libraries, read CS related Medium Articles, ***vibe to Rap and R&B***, as well as perusing the popular subreddits r/MemeEconomy and r/ProgrammerHumor. You can also visit my website [here](the-indian-chinna.github.io).

<p>

<ul>
	<li><h4>Purdueâ€™s C-Design Laboratory, Machine Learning Engineer</h4></li>
		<ul>
    		<li>Developed a deep learning multi-stage framework that uses geometry changes on a hand surface and focuses on learning interactions between a primary and assistive hand/object for hand action recognition by using PyTorch.</li>
    		<li>Implemented the YOLOv4 network to locate the primary and assistive hand/object for the localization stage.</li>
			<li>Integrated ResNet18 to classify the located objects which allows hand action predictions to be contextualized.</li>
  		</ul>
	<li><h4>Purdueâ€™s CAM2 COVID-19 Team, Software Engineer</h4></li>
		<ul>
    		<li>Employed computer vision methods such as scene classification, crowd density estimation and distance estimation on a system of 30,000 cameras to quantify social distancing effectiveness by using TensorFlow 2.</li>
    		<li>Created an interactive website to showcase CAM 2â€™s data, analysis, and academic papers with React.js and Flask.</li>
			<li>Designed a system to validate .5 TB of image data per week by identifying dead or blurry cameras with OpenCV.</li>
  		</ul>
	<li><h4>Purdueâ€™s HELPS Laboratory, Team Leader</h4></li>
		<ul>
    		<li>Developed a Flask based GitHub Bot which automates parts of code review through functionality ranging from managing user and issue dependencies to recognizing and ranking redundant and logically defected code with NLP.</li>
    		<li>Led a team of 10 software engineers in developing and releasing a bot, implemented a system for collecting user data to allow us to devise future updates, built a product website and submitted a research paper to JOSS.</li>
  		</ul>
