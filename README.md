## Hi, my name is Akhil Chinnakotla üëã
I am a ***software engineer*** with a passion for Full-Stack Development, Operating Systems,  as well as Machine Learning. I constantly explore these areas of interest by engaging in ***project-based learning*** through professional, academic and personal avenues. Currently I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in ***Computer Engineering at Purdue University*** with a more software focused course selection. In my free time I like to experiment with New Frameworks and Libraries, read CS related Medium Articles, ***vibe to Rap and R&B***, as well as perusing the popular subreddits r/MemeEconomy and r/ProgrammerHumor. You can also visit my website [here](the-indian-chinna.github.io).

Feel free to reach out in case you want to get in touch:

  <summary><h3>Research Experience</h3></summary>
  * Purdue‚Äôs C-Design Laboratory
			  ‚ùë &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed a deep learning multi-stage framework that uses geometry changes on a hand surface and focuses on learning interactions between a primary and assistive hand/object for hand action recognition by using PyTorch.
			  ‚ùë &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implemented the YOLOv4 network to locate the primary and assistive hand/object for the localization stage.
			  ‚ùë &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated ResNet18 to classify the located objects which allows hand action predictions to be contextualized.
